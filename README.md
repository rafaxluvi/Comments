Immersed is a web application for cyber security training and education for many different organizations. Immersed is an MVP and due to the proprietary nature of the code, only snippets of code are included. This repository includes .NET, SQL, and React code for the Comment section.

My role as a software engineer was to implement the functionality of the comment section. I built codes from the backend to the frontend. Below is a list of actions I was responsible for building. 

● Developed and structured a real time comment section from front-end to back-end.

● Created stored procedures in SQL utilizing joins and foreign keys.

● Built the API endpoints with .NET using C# and thoroughly tested with Postman.

● Designed components in React to maximize aesthetics and functionality.

● Utilized styling with CSS and Bootstrap.

● Focused on best practices using proper naming convention and casing to avoid compiler issues with team member’s code.

● Maintained workflow using GitBash and GitHub for repo management.

● Created new branches to maintain organization throughout the project.

● Performed commits and pull requests to secure consistency and quality.

● Participated in daily stand-ups, code review, and code talks with fellow software engineers to ensure cohesive implementation of code.
